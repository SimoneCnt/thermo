Introduction to Thermo
======================

Thermo calculates an approximation of thermodynamics quantities like entropy
and free energy for molecular systems. The calculation is based on closed-form
expressions derived from statistical mechanics, essentially obtained under the
rigid rotor and harmonic oscillator (RRHO) approximations.

Thermo evaluates the internal energy, the entropy and the free energy of
molecules from their molecular properties like the mass, the moments of
inertia, or the vibrational frequencies. 

In the following, it will be described how to download and install the code and
how to use it with some examples. Next, a Theory chapter aims at describing the
underlying statistical mechanics to understand how this works and under which
approximations and limits the obtained results can be interpreted.
