Introduction to Thermo
======================

Thermo is a software that calculates an estimation of the thermodynamics 
quantities of a molecular system based on closed-form expressions derived 
from a statistical mechanics approach. This involves the calculation of
energy, entropy and free energy of molecules from their molecular properties
like the mass, the moments of inertia, or the vibrational frequencies. 

In the next chapters, it will be described  how to download and install the
code and how to use it with some examples. Next, a Theory chapter aims to 
described in details the underlying statistical mechanics to understand how 
this works and under which approximations and limits the obtained results can 
be interpreted (currently it is a work in progress).
