    Dimerization of Insulin
    -----------------------

Based on the data published in

    B. Tidor and M.Karplus, "The Contribution of Vibrational Entropy to 
    Molecular Association: The Dimerization of Insulin", Journal of 
    Molecular Biology, 238(3) 1994 pp. 405-414

Translational and rotational contribution are in good agreement with the
paper, while the vibrational ones are incorrect due to the limited number
of frequences reported in the main text.


Run this example with:

    thermo -A monomer.inp -B dimer.inp --stechio 2:1 > insulin.out

The reference output is insulin.out.ref
